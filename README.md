You are a peaceful FARMER with a small Cornfield.
One day, during your labour, you see on the ground a fresh footprint.
You take a closer look to the footprint and realize that is not a normal footprint.
Is big, REALLY big, it has claws, and it has rest of blood.
There is no time to be scared. You have to RUN.

# Set Up:

All blinks load showing the Cornfield.
Arrange the Cornfield as you want, for better gameplay all Blinks should touch at least 2 Blinks.

Choose KEY Blink: Pick a Blink and leave it alone, this Blink will be the KEY Blink for both players and will show both colors.
DoubleClick again to randomize starting player.
Every time you put the KEY on the Cornfield, it reveals the position of the MONSTER/FARMER and let you play.

To start the game, every player start on a side of the cornfield, aproximate the KEY and choose a starting spot. The KEY MUST touch that starting spot on the first move.

KEY shows the active player, the other player close their eyes. (MONSTER is RED player, FARMER is GREEN player)

The game go in rounds following this scheme:

1 - Active Player attach the KEY blink on any point of the Cornfield, revealing the actual position of that player. 

2 - Active Player have to choose ONE action:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-Move: Press a neighbour blink of your actual position to move to that spot.
      
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-Smell/Hear: Press your actual position to Smell if you are the MONSTER or Hear if you are the FARMER. 

(If you are the monster and the farmer is on a neighbor cell, you smell it and 3 surroundings blinks became YELLOW, one of them has the farmer, if you are the farmer and the monster is on a neighbour cell, you hear it and all surroundings blinks became YELLOW but you don't know where is the monster. If you don´t find anything, only your tile will flash YELLOW)
      
3 - Once action is done, KEY turns BLUE, now you can pick it and it will change to the colour of the next player. Pass the KEY and next player Round begin.

# Win / Lose condition:

If the FARMER survive 20 rounds. FARMER Win. And the board turn GREEN.

# Advanced Mode: (18 Blinks recomended)

As a THIRD action, in their turn, players can remove from the cornfield ONE blink and put it on a new spot reshaping the Cornfield.
You can remove ANY blink EXCEPT the blink YOU are actually in. (Because you can´t teleport!)
But you can remove the blink where the other player is (Use it in your own benefice if you think you know where the other player is)
