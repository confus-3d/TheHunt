All blinks load showing the Cornfield.
Arrange the Cornfield as you want, for better gameplay all Blinks should touch at least 2 Blinks.

Choose KEY Blink: Pick a Blink and leave it alone, this Blink will be the KEY Blink for both players and will show both colors.
DoubleClick again to randomize starting player.
Every time you put the KEY on the Cornfield, it reveals the position of the MONSTER/FARMER and let you play.

To start the game, every player start on a side of the cornfield, aproximate the KEY and choose a starting spot. The KEY MUST touch that starting spot on the first move.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-Smell/Hear: Press your actual position to Smell if you are the MONSTER or Hear if you are the FARMER. 

(If you smell the Farmer, 3 surroundings blinks became YELLOW, one of them has the Farmer, if you hear the Monster all surroundings blinks became YELLOW, one of them has the Monster. If you don´t find your oponent, only your tile will flash YELLOW)
      
3 - Once action is done, KEY turns BLUE, now you can pick it and it will change to the colour of the next player. Pass the KEY and next player Round begin.

# Advanced Mode: 

As a THIRD action, in their turn, players can remove from the cornfield ONE blink and put it on a new spot reshaping the Cornfield.
You can remove ANY blink EXCEPT the blink YOU are actually in. (Because you can´t teleport!)
But you can remove the blink where the other player is (Use it in your own benefice if you think you know where the other player is)
